This repository was created as part of my final individual project for the MEng Computer Science 4th year dissertation. It aims to explore the dynamics of a high performing, Deep Learning trader, trained solely on data derived from the observation of Level-2 data from the Limit Order Book (LOB) of a simulated financial exchange. The simulation, Threaded-BSE, intends to replicate the asynchronous and parallel nature of real life markets, being a multithreaded extension of the Bristol Stock Exchange.
